# LocalVideoWall
A single simple page that takes video files and tiles them to make a video wall. No upload anywhere. All local in your browser.

There's not many bells or whistles. This was just a little experiment to build the most lightweight tool for this without using external dependencies.

Pull requests to improve or add functionalities are welcome.

One of the main missing thing is a loading indicator while the browser reads the files.

# Minimalism
The whole code of the slideshow page is less than 5KB or just 100 lines of pure html + CSS + JS.
