    <h1>Local Video Wall Playlist</h1>
    <p>LocalVideoWallPlaylist is a single html static file that allows you to specify a few local video files and it display a wall of videos. Nothing is uploaded to any server. Everything is kept locally in your browser. This works offline if you save the page first.</p>
    <p>This is made with a different twist from the other video wall of <a href="https://fafournier.github.io/LocalVideoWall/">F² Microtools suite</a> as it uses a fixed grid and manages a repeating playlist rather than fitting all of the videos on the wall at once</p>
    <p>There's not many bells or whisles. This was just a little experiment to build the most lightweight tool for this without using external dependencies.</p>
    <p>Pull requests to improve or add functionalities are welcome.</p>

    <p>This tool is part of the <a href="https://fafournier.github.io/MicroTools/">F² MicroTools suite</a>. A collection of tools that that are tiny, with no dependencies and typically just do one thing.</p>
